# paint_the_circle
ML project that finds the circle in a given style of images, implemented via PyTorch.

Our model's neural network is defined in model.py, and training the model on the test images resulted in model.dat.

The training and validation process is defined in paint_the_circle_project.ipynb, and the final results on a new test batch can be viewed in 
check_before_submission.ipynb.
